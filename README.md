# SIFT-KNN-Custom-CNN-and-ResNet-18-Plant-Leaf-Disease

## Steps to run the files:
1. Clone the repository using **git clone** or other methods.
2. Navigate into the repository folder and open your favorite editor there.
3. Download the PlantVillage dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) in the same folder as in step 2.
4. Run the files in the **Data Preprocessing and Dataset Generator** folder to get the train, validation and test files.
5. For the baseline SIFT-KNN models, run the files in the **SIFT KNN Baseline** folder.
6. For the custom CNN models, run the files in the **Custom CNN** folder.
7. For the pre-trained ResNet-18 model, run the file in the **Pretrained ResNet-18 Model** folder.

To read the report, please download the report **Comparative Analysis of SIFT-KNN, Custom CNN, and ResNet-18 for Plant Leaf Disease Detection.pdf** from the TLD.
